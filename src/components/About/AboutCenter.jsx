            <h2 className='text-2xl font-medium mt-3'>My Story</h2>
            <p className='mt-4'>I am Awais, a software engineer, the founder of name. My native place is a coastal village in south India. I am born in a humble middle-class family. My father was a school teacher who worked hard to make ends meet.</p>

            <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-8'>Entrepreneurship</h2>
            <p className='my-5'>
                When I was an infant, my father attempted to become an entrepreneur. He invested all his savings, with the help of an additional loan, and started a tiny multi-utility store. Unfortunately, it didn’t last long.
                <br/><br/>
                A fire accident ravaged the store, and we lost everything. We were back to square one, actually zero. My father buried his dream of entrepreneurship and went back to employment.
                <br/><br/>
                I always carried those remnants within me

            <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-8'>City welcomes you</h2>
            <p className='my-5'>
                “Chennai welcomes you,” the signboard greeted me as I embarked on a new chapter of my life. Immediately after completing my college education, I moved to Chennai in search of a job in IT. It was a little uncommon for girls from my village to venture out alone to a metropolitan city.
                <br/><br/>
                We were sent to college with the hopes that we would find a good groom. Nothing more, nothing less, was expected. However, I was determined to work in IT in a city, and my father supported my decision.
                <br/><br/>
                Chennai was the most happening place and the IT hub of India. Although I couldn’t secure an IT job initially, I was adamant about not returning home.
                <br/><br/>
                I took up various jobs to survive, from selling credit cards on the streets to selling software CDs in the market and working as a data entry operator. The list of odd jobs I did for survival was long

            <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-8'>A Software Engineer is born</h2>
            <p className='my-5'>
                I made sure to always have a copy of my resume in hand, ready to distribute to anyone I met. Eventually, I landed my dream job at a startup in Chennai specializing in web development. I enjoyed every moment of it.
                <br/><br/>
                I strongly believe in the startup culture. The electric atmosphere, agile practices, rapidly changing targets, and array of challenges all played a crucial role in shaping my experience. From gathering requirements to design, coding, testing, documentation, delivery, release management, training, and support, the startup environment offered a dynamic and multifaceted experience.
                <br/><br/>
                The pressure cooker scenario of a startup can melt, shape, and make you a star. If you’re graduating, I urge you to choose your initial workplace carefully. It’s not the CMMI levels, skyscraper buildings, or swinging glass doors that will shape you. Instead, it’s the team and your boss that are crucial.
